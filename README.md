# Page 264 - Prime Numbers

First 11 prime integers.

## Program Description:

The first 11 prime integers are `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31`. 
A positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), other than the first 11 prime integers, 
is prime if it is not divisible by **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31**. 
Write a program that takes positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and that outputs whether the number is prime. 
If the number is out of bounds output `out of bound` but if the number is not prime, 
then output all the numbers, from the list of the first 11 prime integers, which divide the number.


```
Input: 2
Output: Number 2 is prime!

Input: 6
Output: 2 3

Input: 210
Output: 2 3 5 7

Input: 47
Output: Number 47 is prime!
```
